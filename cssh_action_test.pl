#
# Purpose: ClusterSSH does not deal well with compound commands as
# handed to the '-a' flag, eg.
#
#   cssh [remote_server] -a "cd /; ls; sleep 10"
#
# The directory listed will be the local working directory, /not/ the
# remote root directory.  This file is a working example that exhibits
# the precise same behaviour.  Almost all of the code here has been
# pasted and shortened to its essence from App/ClusterSSH.pm (in
# /usr/share/perl5 on my system).  That makes it slightly longer than
# strictly necessary but code here can now easily be matched with code
# in the ClusterSSH module.
#
# Looking at the eval()ed and exec()ed strings below, one can easily see
# how appropriate quoting will break the expression in $helper_script.
# Eg. trying to protect the inner expression with single quotes,
#
#   cssh [remote_server] -a "'cd /; ls; sleep 10'"
#
# or
#
#   perl cluster_test.pl [remote_server] -a "'cd /; ls; sleep 20'"
#
# will spectacularly fail.  On the other hand, an expression like
#
#   perl cluster_test.pl [remote_server] -a "\\\"cd /; ls; sleep 20\\\""
#
# works as it transports both backslashes and quotes safely through
# two layers of string interpolation (first Perl's, then the shell's).
# This translates straightforward into
#
#   cssh [cluster] -a "\\\"cd /; ls; sleep 10\\\""
#
#
# Proposed Solution:
# ------------------
# NaÃ¯vely, I'd say substitute $config{command} in $helper_script with
# the unwieldy construct
#
#   \\\"$config{command}\\\"
#
# and be done with it.  But deep down I'd know: this whole part needs
# more thought and less brittle quoting magic.
