The famous misc repoâ„¢
========================

A very volatile repository of arbitrary things.  Now you're up to speed.

Contents
-----------

  + init.d_revssh, a init-script that keeps a reverse ssh session alive.

  + dot_gitconfig, A trivial git configuration file, usable as
    ~/.gitconfig

  + cssh_action_test.pl, A small script that exhibits the same odd
    behaviour as ClusterSSH when issuing compound commands with the '-a'
    flag.  /Heavily/ commented!

  + pink_noise.sh, a better, off-line version of simplynoise.com.
